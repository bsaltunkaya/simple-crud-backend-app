I recently completed a YouTube tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org on building APIs using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Throughout the tutorial, I learned how to set up and develop a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 

I also gained experience using Postman and Insomnia to monitor the health and functionality of my API requests. The application was hosted on port 3000 of my localhost and was designed to interact with a simple MongoDB database.

If you're interested, you can check out the tutorial here: [freeCodeCamp API Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7UQPve99r4).
